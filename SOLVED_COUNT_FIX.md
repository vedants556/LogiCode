# Solved Problems Count Fix

## Issue

The application was showing incorrect solved problem counts and completion percentages (e.g., 2 problems showing as 5 solved with 250% completion). This was caused by duplicate entries in the `solved` table.

### Root Cause

When users submitted solutions multiple times (either through test case checking or AI validation), new records were inserted into the `solved` table without checking if the problem was already marked as solved. This resulted in:

- Multiple entries for the same user-problem combination
- Inflated solved counts (even with `COUNT(DISTINCT q_id)`)
- Incorrect completion percentages

## Solution

### 1. Backend API Changes (`backend/index.js`)

#### Fixed `/api/solved` Endpoint

**Before:**

```javascript
app.post("/api/solved", (req, res) => {
  db.query(
    "insert into solved(q_id, user_id) values (? , ?);",
    [qid, userid],
    (err, result) => {
      // ...
    }
  );
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
app.post("/api/solved", (req, res) => {
  // First check if already solved to prevent duplicates
  db.query(
    "SELECT * FROM solved WHERE q_id = ? AND user_id = ?",
    [qid, userid],
    (err, result) => {
      if (result.length > 0) {
        res.json({ status: "already_solved" });
        return;
      }

      // Insert only if not already solved
      db.query(
        "INSERT INTO solved(q_id, user_id) VALUES (?, ?)",
        [qid, userid]
        // ...
      );
    }
  );
});
```

#### Fixed `/api/checkbyai` Endpoint

Similar duplicate check added before inserting solved records when AI validates code as passing.

### 2. Database Migration

Created migration script: `backend/migrations/fix_duplicate_solved_records.sql`

This migration:

1. Removes all duplicate entries from the `solved` table
2. Keeps only one record per user-problem combination
3. Adds a `UNIQUE KEY` constraint to prevent future duplicates

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Backup Your Database

```bash
mysqldump -u your_username -p your_database > backup_before_fix.sql
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration

**Option A: Using the migration runner**

```bash
cd backend
node run_migration.js migrations/fix_duplicate_solved_records.sql
```

**Option B: Manually via MySQL CLI**

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < backend/migrations/fix_duplicate_solved_records.sql
```

**Option C: Copy-paste into MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin**
Open the migration file and execute it in your MySQL client.

### Step 3: Restart Your Application

```bash
# If using npm
npm restart

# If using PM2
pm2 restart all

# If running manually
# Stop the current process and start again
node backend/index.js
```

## Verification

After applying the fix, you can verify it worked:

### 1. Check for Duplicates

```sql
SELECT q_id, user_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM solved
GROUP BY q_id, user_id
HAVING count > 1;
```

This should return **0 rows** if the fix worked correctly.

### 2. Check User Stats

Log in as a user and check:

- Profile page shows correct solved count
- Home dashboard shows correct completion percentage
- Problem list shows accurate progress stats

### 3. Test Duplicate Prevention

1. Solve a problem
2. Submit the same problem again
3. Check the database - should still have only 1 record for that user-problem combination

## Expected Results

- ✅ Accurate solved problem counts
- ✅ Correct completion percentages
- ✅ No duplicate entries in the solved table
- ✅ Prevention of future duplicates

## Technical Details

### Unique Constraint

The migration adds a unique constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE solved
ADD UNIQUE KEY unique_user_problem (q_id, user_id);
```

This ensures at the database level that no two records can have the same `q_id` and `user_id` combination.

### Frontend Impact

No frontend changes are required. The fix is entirely backend-focused:

- `frontend/src/components/Output.jsx` continues to call `/api/solved`
- The backend now handles duplicate prevention automatically

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails

**Error: "Duplicate key name 'unique_user_problem'"**

- The unique constraint already exists, which is fine
- You can comment out the ALTER TABLE line in the migration

**Error: "Duplicate entry"**

- Some duplicates still exist
- Run the DELETE and INSERT steps again
- Or manually identify and remove duplicates:

```sql
DELETE s1 FROM solved s1
INNER JOIN solved s2
WHERE s1.s_id > s2.s_id
AND s1.q_id = s2.q_id
AND s1.user_id = s2.user_id;
```
