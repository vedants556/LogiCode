## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MySQL
- Gemini API key (free)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afayan/logicode.git

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   Install npm packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Create .env file with your mysql passord and Gemini API key beside the index.js file

   your env file must look like this:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   SQL_PASSWORD='your-sql-password'
   ```

   Create the neccessary SQL tables. (queries and schema given in info.txt)

   Run the server

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Setup the frontend
   Open another terminal

   Navigate to frontend and install the packages

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   Run the server

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
