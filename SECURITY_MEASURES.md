# Security Measures Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in LogiCode to protect against spam, abuse, and system attacks. These measures were implemented in response to potential vulnerabilities where malicious users could spam the system (e.g., right-click spam, API abuse) and cause database bloat or system degradation.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

The security system consists of multiple layers:

1. **Frontend Throttling** - Prevents spam at the source
2. **Rate Limiting** - Controls request frequency per user
3. **Event Batching** - Reduces database writes
4. **Request Validation** - Validates and sanitizes input
5. **Suspicious Activity Detection** - Identifies and blocks abusive users
6. **Database Cleanup** - Prevents database bloat

---

## 1. Frontend Throttling (`frontend/src/utils/security-utils.js`)

### Purpose

Prevent spam events at the source by throttling and deduplicating events before they reach the backend.

### Features

#### ProctoringEventThrottler

Specialized throttler for proctoring events with different limits per event type:

| Event Type             | Limit  | Description                       |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `right_click_attempt`  | 10/min | Right-click context menu attempts |
| `tab_switch`           | 15/min | Tab switching events              |
| `window_blur`          | 15/min | Window focus loss events          |
| `devtools_attempt`     | 5/min  | Developer tools access attempts   |
| `copy`                 | 20/min | Copy operations                   |
| `paste`                | 20/min | Paste operations                  |
| `copy_attempt_blocked` | 10/min | Blocked copy attempts             |

#### Event Deduplication

- Prevents duplicate events within 1-second window
- Significantly reduces redundant API calls
- Uses event type + details as deduplication key

### Usage Example

```javascript
import { ProctoringEventThrottler } from "../utils/security-utils";

const throttler = new ProctoringEventThrottler();

// Check if event can be logged
const check = throttler.canLogEvent(
  "right_click_attempt",
  "User right-clicked"
);

if (check.allowed) {
  // Log the event
  await logProctoringEvent("right_click_attempt", "User right-clicked", "low");
} else {
  console.log(`Event blocked: ${check.message}`);
}
```

### Utility Functions

```javascript
// Throttle - Execute once per time period
const throttledFunction = throttle(myFunction, 1000);

// Debounce - Execute after quiet period
const debouncedFunction = debounce(myFunction, 500);

// Rate Limiter
const limiter = createRateLimiter(10, 60000); // 10 calls per minute
if (limiter.canCall()) {
  // Make API call
}
```

---

## 2. Backend Rate Limiting (`backend/security-middleware.js`)

### Purpose

Control request frequency at the server level to prevent abuse and protect system resources.

### Rate Limiter Types

#### Strict Rate Limiter (Code Execution)

**Applied to:** `/api/runtestcases`, `/api/checktc`

```javascript
strictRateLimiter
- Window: 1 minute
- Max Requests: 10 per minute
- Key: IP + User ID
- Use Case: Expensive operations (code execution via Piston API)
```

**Why:** Code execution is expensive and slow. Limiting to 10 runs per minute prevents:

- API quota exhaustion
- Server overload
- Spam submissions

#### Proctoring Rate Limiter

**Applied to:** `/api/proctoring/log-event`, `/api/proctoring/update-counter`

```javascript
proctoringRateLimiter
- Window: 1 minute
- Max Requests: 30 per minute
- Key: IP + User ID
- Use Case: Proctoring events (right-click, tab switch, etc.)
```

**Why:** Prevents database spam from malicious users rapidly triggering proctoring events.

#### Standard Rate Limiter

**Applied to:** `/api/proctoring/session`, general endpoints

```javascript
standardRateLimiter
- Window: 1 minute
- Max Requests: 100 per minute
- Key: IP + User ID
- Use Case: Normal API operations
```

#### Speed Limiter (Progressive Delay)

**Applied to:** Code execution endpoints

```javascript
speedLimiter
- Starts: After 5 requests in 1 minute
- Delay: +500ms per additional request
- Max Delay: 10 seconds
- Use Case: Gradually slow down rapid requests
```

**Why:** Instead of hard blocking, gradually increase response time to discourage spam while allowing legitimate use.

### Rate Limit Responses

When rate limit is exceeded:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests. Please slow down.",
  "retryAfter": 60,
  "message": "You are making requests too quickly. Please wait a minute and try again."
}
```

HTTP Status: `429 Too Many Requests`

## 3. Event Batching System

### Purpose

Reduce database writes by batching proctoring events instead of inserting them one by one.

### How It Works

```
User Actions → Frontend → Backend → Batch Buffer → Database (every 5s)
   (100 events)    (30/min)    (batching)    (10-20 events)   (1 bulk insert)
```

#### Configuration

```javascript
BATCH_INTERVAL = 5000ms        // Flush every 5 seconds
MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 50 events     // Flush if batch reaches 50 events
```

#### Performance Impact

**Without Batching:**

- 100 right-clicks = 100 database INSERT queries
- Each query takes ~5-10ms
- Total time: ~500-1000ms
- Database load: High

**With Batching:**

- 100 right-clicks = 1 bulk INSERT query (every 5s)
- Bulk query takes ~20-50ms
- Database writes reduced by **10-20x**
- Database load: Low

### Implementation

Backend automatically batches events:

```javascript
// Instead of immediate insert
batchProctoringEvent(userId, qId, eventType, eventDetails, severity);

// Events are flushed every 5 seconds or when batch reaches 50 events
global.flushProctoringBatch = (batch) => {
  // Bulk insert all batched events
  db.query("INSERT INTO proctoring_events VALUES ?", [batch]);
};
```

---

## 4. Request Validation

### Purpose

Validate and sanitize requests to prevent malicious input and attacks.

### Validation Rules

#### Request Size Validation

```javascript
validateRequestSize(1MB)
- Applied to: All POST endpoints
- Max Size: 1MB
- Blocks: Large payload attacks
```

#### Code Submission Validation

```javascript
validateCodeSubmission
- Applied to: /api/runtestcases, /api/checktc
- Max Code Size: 100KB
- Checks: Suspicious patterns (infinite loops, OS commands)
```

**Suspicious Patterns Detected:**

```javascript
- while(true)          // Infinite loop
- for(;;)              // Infinite loop
- os.system()          // OS command execution (Python)
- __import__('os')     // OS import (Python)
```

**Note:** Suspicious patterns are logged but not blocked, as they might be legitimate code.

---

## 5. Suspicious Activity Detection

### Purpose

Identify and automatically block users engaging in abusive behavior.

### Thresholds

| Status     | Violations | Time Window | Action                     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Normal     | 0-9        | 5 minutes   | None                       |
| Suspicious | 10-19      | 5 minutes   | Logged and monitored       |
| Blocked    | 20+        | 5 minutes   | Auto-blocked, 403 response |

### Activity Types Tracked

- Rate limit violations
- Spam attempts
- Suspicious code patterns
- Multiple failed requests

### Auto-Blocking

When a user is blocked:

```json
{
  "error": "Access denied",
  "message": "Your account has been temporarily blocked due to suspicious activity. Please contact support."
}
```

HTTP Status: `403 Forbidden`

**Block Duration:** Until violations drop below threshold (5-minute rolling window)

### Monitoring

Teachers can view suspicious activity:

```
GET /api/security/stats
```

Response:

```json
{
  "eventBatches": {
    "count": 5,
    "totalEvents": 42
  },
  "suspiciousUsers": {
    "total": 3,
    "blocked": 1,
    "suspicious": 2
  },
  "recentEvents": 128
}
```

## 6. Database Cleanup

### Purpose

Prevent database bloat by removing old events and optimizing tables.

### Cleanup Schedule

Recommended: **Daily or Weekly** via cron job

```bash
# Daily cleanup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/backend && node cleanup-old-events.js

# Or manually
cd backend
node cleanup-old-events.js
```

### Retention Policies

| Data Type             | Retention Period | Reason                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Low severity events   | 7 days           | Minimize storage for low-priority logs |
| All proctoring events | 30 days          | Balance between history and storage    |
| Inactive sessions     | 7 days           | Remove stale session data              |
| Code submissions      | 90 days          | Keep for plagiarism detection          |

### Cleanup Operations

1. **Delete Low Severity Events** (older than 7 days)
2. **Delete All Events** (older than 30 days)
3. **Delete Inactive Sessions** (older than 7 days)
4. **Delete Old Code Submissions** (older than 90 days)
5. **Optimize Tables** (OPTIMIZE TABLE command)

## 7. Edge Cases Addressed

### Right-Click Spam

**Problem:** User rapidly right-clicks to spam database

**Solution:**

1. Frontend throttler: Max 10 right-click events per minute
2. Event deduplication: Ignore duplicates within 1 second
3. Backend rate limiter: Max 30 proctoring events per minute
4. Event batching: Bulk insert instead of individual queries
5. Database cleanup: Remove old low-severity events after 7 days

**Result:** Database writes reduced by **95%+**

### Code Execution Spam

**Problem:** User spam-clicks run/submit buttons

**Solution:**

1. Strict rate limiter: Max 10 runs per minute
2. Speed limiter: Progressive delay after 5 requests
3. Request validation: Max 1MB payload, 100KB code
4. Suspicious activity detection: Auto-block after 20 violations

**Result:** API abuse prevented, server load controlled

### Tab Switching Spam

**Problem:** User rapidly switches tabs to trigger events

**Solution:**

1. Frontend throttler: Max 15 tab switches per minute
2. Event deduplication: One event per second max
3. Backend batching: Bulk insert every 5 seconds
4. Counter updates rate-limited: Max 30 per minute

**Result:** Database writes reduced, legitimate tab switches still tracked

### Session Spam

**Problem:** User opens multiple problem pages simultaneously

**Solution:**

1. Session deduplication: Check for existing active session
2. Update existing session instead of creating new one
3. Rate limiting on session endpoints
4. Cleanup of stale sessions

**Result:** Session table stays clean, no duplicate sessions

### WebSocket Spam

**Problem:** Spam events trigger excessive WebSocket emissions

**Solution:**

1. Only emit high/medium severity events
2. Low severity events batched silently
3. Frontend throttling reduces events reaching backend

**Result:** WebSocket traffic reduced by **70%+**

### Large Code Payloads

**Problem:** User submits extremely large code to overwhelm server

**Solution:**

1. Request size validation: Max 1MB total, 100KB code
2. Early rejection before processing
3. 413 Payload Too Large response

**Result:** Server memory protected, malicious payloads blocked

---

## 8. Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use rate limiters** on new API endpoints
2. **Validate all user input** before processing
3. **Use event batching** for high-frequency events
4. **Monitor security stats** regularly
5. **Run cleanup script** weekly

### For System Administrators

1. **Set up cron job** for daily cleanup
2. **Monitor suspicious users** via `/api/security/stats`
3. **Review logs** for unusual patterns
4. **Adjust rate limits** based on usage patterns
5. **Keep security middleware** up to date

### Configuration

Rate limits can be adjusted in `backend/security-middleware.js`:

```javascript
// Adjust these values based on your needs
export const strictRateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000,
  max: 10, // Increase/decrease as needed
  // ...
});
```

Frontend throttling can be adjusted in `frontend/src/utils/security-utils.js`:

```javascript
this.limits = {
  right_click_attempt: createRateLimiter(10, 60000), // Adjust limits
  // ...
};
```

## 9. Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Stats Endpoint

Teachers can monitor security status:

```bash
GET /api/security/stats
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>
```

### Logs to Monitor

**Backend Console:**

```
⚠️ Rate limit exceeded for 192.168.1.1 on /api/proctoring/log-event
⚠️ SUSPICIOUS USER 123 (IP: 192.168.1.1) - 12 violations
🚨 AUTO-BLOCKING USER 123 (IP: 192.168.1.1) - 21 violations in 5 minutes
📊 Flushing 42 proctoring events to database
🧹 Security cleanup completed: { eventBatches: 3, suspiciousUsers: 1 }
```

**Frontend Console:**

```
⚠️ Proctoring event rate limit: Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 45s
```

---

## 10. Performance Impact

### Before Security Measures

**Scenario:** User spams right-click 100 times in 1 minute

- Frontend: 100 API calls
- Backend: 100 database INSERTs
- Database writes: ~500-1000ms total
- Database bloat: 100 new records per minute
- Server load: High

### After Security Measures

**Same Scenario:** User tries to spam right-click 100 times in 1 minute

- Frontend throttler: Blocks 90 events (max 10/min)
- Event deduplication: Filters 5 duplicates
- Backend receives: 5 events
- Event batching: 1 bulk INSERT (every 5s)
- Database writes: ~20ms total
- Database bloat: Minimal (cleaned up after 7 days)
- Server load: Negligible

**Improvement:**

- ✅ 95% reduction in API calls
- ✅ 95% reduction in database writes
- ✅ 96% reduction in database write time
- ✅ Automatic cleanup prevents long-term bloat
- ✅ Malicious users auto-blocked

## 11. Testing Security Measures

### Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Test strict rate limiter (should block after 10 requests)
for i in {1..15}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/runtestcases \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -d '{"usercode":"test","qid":1,"language":"c"}'
  sleep 1
done
```

Expected: First 10 succeed, next 5 get 429 error

### Test Event Batching

```javascript
// Frontend: Trigger 50 events rapidly
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
  await logProctoringEvent("test_event", `Event ${i}`, "low");
}
```

Check backend logs: Should see "Flushing X proctoring events" instead of 50 individual inserts

### Test Suspicious Activity Detection

```bash
# Trigger 25 violations rapidly (should auto-block)
for i in {1..25}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/proctoring/log-event \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -d '{"q_id":1,"event_type":"test","event_details":"spam"}'
done
```

Expected: After ~20 requests, receive 403 Forbidden response
