About
Piston is a high performance general purpose code execution engine. It excels at running untrusted and possibly malicious code without fear from any harmful effects.

It's used in numerous places including:

EMKC Challenges
EMKC Weekly Contests
Engineer Man Discord Server
Web IDEs
200+ direct integrations

Official Extensions
The following are approved and endorsed extensions/utilities to the core Piston offering.

I Run Code, a Discord bot used in 4100+ servers to handle arbitrary code evaluation in Discord. To get this bot in your own server, go here: https://emkc.org/run.
Piston CLI, a universal shell supporting code highlighting, files, and interpretation without the need to download a language.
Node Piston Client, a Node.js wrapper for accessing the Piston API.
Piston4J, a Java wrapper for accessing the Piston API.
Pyston, a Python wrapper for accessing the Piston API.
Go-Piston, a Golang wrapper for accessing the Piston API.
piston_rs, a Rust wrapper for accessing the Piston API.
piston_rspy, Python bindings for accessing the Piston API via piston_rs.

Public API
Requires no installation and you can use it immediately.
Reference the Runtimes/Execute sections below to learn about the request and response formats.

When using the public Piston API, use the following two URLs:

GET  https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/runtimes
POST https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute
Important Note: The Piston API is rate limited to 5 requests per second. Effective May 7, 2024, no additional unlimited keys will be granted and existing keys will be revoked on Jan 1, 2025. The public instance is at capacity and the public limit is already very generous. For usage beyond 5 requests/second, you should consider self hosting.


Getting Started
All In One
Host System Package Dependencies
Docker
Docker Compose
Node JS (>= 15)
cgroup v2 enabled, and cgroup v1 disabled
After system dependencies are installed, clone this repository:
# clone and enter repo
git clone https://github.com/engineer-man/piston
Note

Ensure the repository is cloned with LF line endings

Installation
# Start the API container
docker-compose up -d api

# Install all the dependencies for the cli
cd cli && npm i && cd -
The API will now be online with no language runtimes installed. To install runtimes, use the CLI.

Just Piston (no CLI)
Host System Package Dependencies
Docker
Installation
docker run \
    --privileged \
    -v $PWD:'/piston' \
    -dit \
    -p 2000:2000 \
    --name piston_api \
    ghcr.io/engineer-man/piston
Piston for testing packages locally
Host System Package Dependencies
Same as All In One
Installation
# Build the Docker containers
./piston start

# For more help
./piston help

Usage
CLI
The CLI is the main tool used for installing packages within piston, but also supports running code.

You can execute the cli with cli/index.js.

# List all available packages
cli/index.js ppman list

# Install latest python
cli/index.js ppman install python

# Install specific version of python
cli/index.js ppman install python=3.9.4

# Run a python script using the latest version
echo 'print("Hello world!")' > test.py
cli/index.js run python test.py

# Run a python script using a specific version
echo 'print("Hello world!")' > test.py
cli/index.js run python test.py -l 3.9.4
cli/index.js run python test.py -l 3.x
cli/index.js run python test.py -l 3
If you are operating on a remote machine, add the -u flag like so:

cli/index.js -u http://piston.server:2000 ppman list
API
The container exposes an API on port 2000 by default. This is used by the CLI to carry out running jobs and package management.

Runtimes Endpoint
GET /api/v2/runtimes This endpoint will return the supported languages along with the current version and aliases. To execute code for a particular language using the /api/v2/execute endpoint, either the name or one of the aliases must be provided, along with the version. Multiple versions of the same language may be present at the same time, and may be selected when running a job.

A typical response upon successful execution will contain 1 or 2 keys run and compile. compile will only be present if the language requested requires a compile stage.

Each of these keys has an identical structure, containing both a stdout and stderr key, which is a string containing the text outputted during the stage into each buffer. It also contains the code and signal which was returned from each process. It also includes a nullable human-readable message which is a description of why a stage has failed and a two-letter status that is either:

RE for runtime error
SG for dying on a signal
TO for timeout (either via timeout or cpu_time)
OL for stdout length exceeded
EL for stderr length exceeded
XX for internal error

Interactive execution endpoint (not available through the public API)
To interact with running processes in real time, you can establish a WebSocket connection at /api/v2/connect. This allows you to both receive output and send input to active processes.

Each message is structured as a JSON object with a type key, which indicates the action to perform. Below is a list of message types, their directions, and descriptions:

init (client -> server): Initializes a job with the same parameters as the /execute endpoint, except that stdin is discarded.
runtime (server -> client): Provides details on the runtime environment, including the version and language.
stage (server -> client): Indicates the current execution stage, either "compile" or "run."
data (server <-> client): Exchanges data between the client and server, such as stdin, stdout, or stderr streams.
signal (client -> server): Sends a signal (e.g., for termination) to the running process, whether it's in the "compile" or "run" stage.
exit (server -> client): Signals the end of a stage, along with the exit code or signal.
error (server -> client): Reports an error, typically right before the WebSocket is closed.
An example of this endpoint in use is depicted below (< = client to server, > = server to client)

Client establishes WebSocket connection to /api/v2/connect
< {"type":"init", "language":"bash", "version":"*", "files":[{"content": "cat"}]}
> {"type":"runtime","language": "bash", "version": "5.1.0"}
> {"type":"stage", "stage":"run"}
< {"type":"data", "stream":"stdin", "data":"Hello World!"}
> {"type":"data", "stream":"stdout", "data":"Hello World!"}
time passes
> {"type":"exit", "stage":"run", "code":null, "signal": "SIGKILL"}
Errors may return status codes as follows:

4000: Already Initialized: Sent when a second init command is issued.
4001: Initialization Timeout: No init command was sent within 1 second of connection.
4002: Notified Error: A fatal error occurred, and an error packet was transmitted.
4003: Not yet Initialized: A non-init command was sent without a job context.
4004: Can only write to stdin: The client attempted to write to a stream other than stdin.
4005: Invalid Signal: An invalid signal was sent in a signal packet.

Principle of Operation
Piston uses Isolate inside Docker as the primary mechanism for sandboxing. There is an API within the container written in Node which takes in execution requests and executes them within the container safely. High level, the API writes any source code and executes it inside an Isolate sandbox. The source file is either ran or compiled and ran (in the case of languages like c, c++, c#, go, etc.).


Security
Piston uses Isolate which makes use of Linux namespaces, chroot, multiple unprivileged users, and cgroup for sandboxing and resource limiting. Code execution submissions on Piston shall not be aware of each other, shall not affect each other and shall not affect the underlying host system. This is ensured through multiple steps including:

Disabling outgoing network interaction by default
Capping max processes at 256 by default (resists :(){ :|: &}:;, while True: os.fork(), etc.)
Capping max files at 2048 (resists various file based attacks)
Cleaning up all temp space after each execution (resists out of drive space attacks)
Running each submission as a different unprivileged user
Running each submission with its own isolated Linux namespaces
Capping runtime execution at 3 seconds by default (CPU-time and wall-time)
Capping the peak memory that all the submission's processes can use
Capping stdout to 1024 characters by default (resists yes/no bombs and runaway output)
SIGKILLing misbehaving code
